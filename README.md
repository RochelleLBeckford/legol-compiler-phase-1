# Legol Compiler - Phase 1

## A simple C program that simulates building and stacking Legol Building Blocks.

- [ ] I am a huge Lego fan so I decided that I want to create a simple compiler based on this. A basic Legol-building-block language and output instructions. A single Legol command will be read from the user and then processes it. Then it will print what it is doing. Lastly the program will end.
- [ ] This is the start of making my own programming language

## What this does?

- [ ] This program asks you to type a command like `BUILD red small`
- [ ] It then prints what it's building based on your command

## How to Use
- [ ] Run the program
- [ ] Type exactly: `BUILD` followed by a color and size
   - [ ] Example: `BUILD blue large`
- [ ] Then the program will respond with what it is building

## Example
```
-> Enter a Legol command (BUILD <color> <size>)
-> BUILD green small
-> Building a small green Legol building block
```

## What You'll Learn
- [ ] This tiny program shows:
  - [ ] How to get user input in C
  - [ ] How to check if text matches certain words
  - [ ] Basic printing to the screen



- [ ] Encompass:
  - [ ] C Programming Language
- [ ] C â†’ This language is best to use when writing a compiler, it is fast, and close to how computers actually work.
